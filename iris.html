    <h2>Irises (Iris spp.) are striking and versatile flowers admired for their bold colors and unique shape. Named after the Greek goddess of the rainbow, irises come in a wide range of hues and are known for their sword-shaped leaves and distinctive, elegant flowers. Here’s a detailed look at irises:</h2>
      <div class="div">
        <strong>1. Scientific Classification:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Plantae</li>
        <li><strong>Family:</strong> Iridaceae</li>
        <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Iris</li>
        <li><strong>Species:</strong> Over 300 species, with numerous hybrids and cultivars.</li>
      </div>
      </ul>

      <div class="div">
      <strong>2. Appearance</strong><br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Iris flowers have three upright petals called “standards” and three drooping petals called “falls.” The flowers come in nearly every color, including blue, purple, yellow, white, and even black, with many varieties featuring beautiful patterns and color contrasts.</li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Depending on the species, irises can range from 6 inches to over 4 feet tall.</li>
          <li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Irises have tall, narrow, sword-like leaves that grow from the base. The foliage often remains attractive throughout the growing season, even after the flowers have faded.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
        <strong>3. Types of Irises:</strong><br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bearded Irises: </strong>Named for the “beard,” or fuzzy strip on the falls, bearded irises are among the most popular and are known for their tall stems and large, ruffled blooms.</li>
          <li><strong>Beardless Irises: </strong>This group includes species like Siberian and Japanese irises, which lack the beard on the falls and are often hardier and more moisture-tolerant.</li>
          <li><strong>Crested Irises: </strong>These have a raised ridge (or crest) on the falls instead of a beard and are generally lower-growing and ideal for rock gardens.</li>
          <li><strong>Bulbous Irises: </strong>This includes varieties like Dutch irises, which grow from bulbs rather than rhizomes and are often used as cut flowers.</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
        <strong>4.Growing Conditions:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Irises are adaptable to a range of climates but generally do well in temperate zones. They require a period of cold to bloom effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Well-draining soil is essential for irises. Bearded irises, in particular, thrive in slightly alkaline soil, while Siberian and Japanese irises prefer more acidic, moisture-retentive soil.</li>
        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Irises need regular watering during the growing season but prefer dry conditions during dormancy. Bearded irises are more drought-tolerant, while Siberian and Japanese irises enjoy moist conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Irises generally require full sun, with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, although some varieties tolerate partial shade.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
      <strong>5. Uses of Peonies: </strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ornamental Plants: </strong>Irises are widely used in gardens and landscapes due to their vibrant colors and architectural appeal. They are often planted in beds, borders, and water gardens.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut Flowers: </strong>Irises are popular as cut flowers in arrangements, especially Dutch irises with their elegant, tall stems and vibrant colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Perfumery and Traditional Medicine: </strong>The rhizomes of certain iris species, particularly Iris germanica, are used in perfumes and aromatherapy due to their delicate fragrance. In traditional medicine, iris extracts have been used for a variety of ailments.</li>
      </ul>
        </div>

      <div class="div">
        <strong>6. Symbolism and Cultural Significance:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Royalty and Wisdom:</strong> The iris symbolizes wisdom, valor, and royalty in various cultures, and it is a symbol associated with monarchs and nobility, particularly in France.</li>
        <li><strong>Religious Symbolism:</strong> The fleur-de-lis, a stylized iris, is an enduring symbol in Christianity and is often used in heraldry and religious art.</li>
        <li><strong>Faith and Hope:</strong> In many cultures, the iris represents faith, hope, and friendship. Purple irises, in particular, are symbols of royalty and admiration.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
        <strong>7. Pests and Diseases:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pests:</strong> Common pests include aphids, iris borers, and slugs, which can damage the foliage and rhizomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Diseases:</strong>Irises can be susceptible to diseases like root rot, bacterial leaf blight, and rust, particularly in overly moist conditions. Good air circulation and proper spacing can help prevent these issues.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="div">
        <strong>8. Propagation:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rhizome Division: </strong>Bearded irises are typically propagated by dividing the rhizomes in late summer or early fall. This helps control plant size and encourages new growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Bulb Planting: </strong>Bulbous irises, like Dutch irises, are grown from bulbs that are planted in the fall for spring blooming.</li>  
        <li><strong>Seeds: </strong>Irises can also be grown from seed, though it may take a few years for plants to reach maturity and bloom.</li>   
      </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
        <strong>9. Interesting Facts:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Irises in Art and Literature: </strong>Irises have been depicted in famous paintings, such as Vincent van Gogh's Irises, and are celebrated for their delicate beauty and color.</li>
        <li><strong>Toxicity: </strong> While stunning in appearance, some parts of the iris plant, particularly the rhizomes, are toxic if ingested by humans or pets.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold-Hardy: </strong>Irises are generally hardy plants that can survive in colder climates, with many species capable of withstanding frost.</li>
      </ul>
      Irises continue to be admired for their beauty and historical symbolism. Their resilience, range of colors, and striking appearance make them a popular choice for gardens, floral arrangements, and cultural representations worldwide.
