    <h1>SUNFLOWER</h1>
    <img src="flowers/sunflower.jpeg" width="500px" height="500px">
    <h2>Sunflowers .(Helianthus annuus) are vibrant, tall flowers that are known for their large, bright yellow petals and their ability to track the sun, a phenomenon called heliotropism. Here are some detailed aspects of the sunflower:</h2>

      <div class="div">
        <strong>1. Scientific Classification:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Plantae</li>
        <li><strong>Family:</strong> Asteraceae (Daisy family)</li>
        <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Helianthus</li>
        <li><strong>Species: </strong>H. annuus</li>
      </div>
      </ul>

      <div class="div">
      <strong>2. Appearance and Structure:</strong><br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Height:</strong>Height: Sunflowers can grow between 3 to 12 feet tall, depending on the variety. Some can grow even taller, with certain varieties reaching heights of over 16 feet.</li>
          <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> The iconic sunflower has a large, round central disk made up of hundreds of tiny flowers (called florets) that mature into seeds. The outer part of the flower is made up of bright yellow petals called ray florets. Some sunflower varieties also have orange, red, or brown petals.</li>
          <li><strong>Leaves:</strong> The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and coarse to the touch. They are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
        <strong>3. Heliotropism:</strong><br>
      Young sunflowers exhibit heliotropism, which means that their heads turn to follow the sun as it moves across the sky. This behavior helps them optimize sunlight for photosynthesis. As the sunflower matures, this movement stops, and the flower usually faces east, which provides better protection against overheating and ensures that pollinators like bees can easily find the flowers in the morning sun.</li>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
        <strong>4. Habitat and Growing Conditions:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Sunflowers thrive in temperate climates and are relatively drought-tolerant. They prefer full sunlight and can grow in a variety of soils, though they do best in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils.</li>
        <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Sunflowers are typically planted in the spring after the last frost and are harvested in late summer or early fall.</li>
        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Sunflowers are drought-resistant but need regular watering to produce large flowers, especially during their initial growth stage.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
      <strong>5. Varieties of Sunflowers:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Single-Stem Sunflowers:</strong>These grow one large bloom on a tall stalk, often seen in large sunflower fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Branching Sunflowers: </strong>These produce multiple blooms on a single plant, creating a bushier appearance.</li>
        <li><strong>Dwarf Sunflowers: </strong> These are shorter varieties that can be grown in pots and small spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Colored Varieties:</strong>Some sunflowers have petals in colors other than yellow, such as red, orange, and burgundy.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="div">
        <strong>6. Uses of Sunflowers:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seeds: </strong>Sunflower seeds are a popular snack and a rich source of healthy fats, particularly omega-6 fatty acids. They are also used to make sunflower oil, which is commonly used in cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunflower Oil: </strong>Extracted from the seeds, this oil is known for being low in saturated fats and is often used in cooking and food production. It is also used in cosmetics.</li>
        <li><strong>Animal Feed:</strong>After the oil is extracted from the seeds, the leftover meal is used as a high-protein ingredient in animal feed.</li>
        <li><strong>Biofuel:</strong>Sunflower oil can be used to produce biodiesel, a renewable energy source.</li>
        <li><strong>Ornamental:</strong>Sunflowers are often grown in gardens for their bright, cheerful appearance and are a favorite of both amateur and professional gardeners.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
        <strong>7. Cultural and Symbolic Significance:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Symbol of Happiness:</strong>Sunflowers are often associated with positivity, warmth, and happiness due to their sunny appearance and bright colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Symbol of Loyalty and Longevity:</strong>In some cultures, sunflowers symbolize loyalty and long life, likely because of their strong and upright stature.</li>
        <li><strong>Van Goghâ€™s Sunflowers:</strong>The sunflower became famous in art through the works of Vincent van Gogh, who painted a series of still-life paintings featuring sunflowers. These paintings have since become some of the most recognized pieces of artwork in the world.</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>8. Ecological Importance:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attract Pollinators: </strong>Sunflowers attract a wide variety of pollinators, including bees, butterflies, and birds, making them beneficial for garden ecosystems</li>
        <li><strong>Wildlife Habitat:</strong> Sunflowers provide a habitat for various insects and birds, which feed on their seeds and use the plant for shelter.</li>
        <li><strong>Companion Planting: </strong>Sunflowers can be used as a natural trellis for climbing plants like beans, and they help attract beneficial insects to gardens, which can control pests.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Sunflowers can absorb toxins from the soil, such as heavy metals like lead, arsenic, and uranium. This property makes them useful for soil remediation in polluted areas.</li>
        <li>A single sunflower head can contain up to 2,000 seeds.</li>
