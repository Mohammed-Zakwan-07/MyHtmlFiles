      <div class="div">
        <strong>1. Scientific Classification:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Plantae</li>
        <li><strong>Family:</strong> Liliaceae (Lily family)</li>
        <li><strong>Genus:</strong>  Lilium</li>
        <li><strong>Species:</strong> Approximately 100 species with numerous hybrids and varieties.</li>
      </div>
      </ul>

      <div class="div">
      <strong>2. Appearance</strong><br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flowers:</strong>Lily flowers are trumpet-shaped or bowl-shaped and vary in colors, including white, yellow, pink, orange, red, and even spotted or striped varieties. The flowers can have a strong, sweet fragrance.</li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Lilies vary in height, with most species reaching between 2 and 6 feet, though some can grow even taller.</li>
          <li><strong>Leaves:</strong> The leaves are lance-shaped, smooth, and grow in whorls along the stem.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
        <strong>3. Types of Lilies:</strong><br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Asiatic Lilies: </strong>Known for their vibrant colors and lack of fragrance. These lilies are often smaller and bloom early in the summer.</li>
          <li><strong>Oriental Lilies: </strong>Fragrant and often larger, Oriental lilies bloom later in the season and come in a range of colors, often with spotted petals.</li>
          <li><strong>Trumpet Lilies: </strong>Known for their large, trumpet-shaped flowers with a strong scent.</li>
          <li><strong>Martagon Lilies: </strong>Also called “Turk’s Cap,” these have recurved petals and are tolerant of partial shade.</li>
          <li><strong>Tiger Lilies: </strong>These have orange flowers with dark spots and are known for their hardiness.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
        <strong>4.Growing Conditions:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Lilies are suited to temperate climates but can adapt to a range of conditions depending on the species.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Well-draining, rich soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH is best. Lilies are sensitive to waterlogging, which can lead to bulb rot.</li>
        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Lilies require moderate watering and should be kept consistently moist, especially during their growing season, but they do not tolerate soggy soil.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Most lilies prefer full sun, though some types, like Martagon lilies, can tolerate partial shade.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div">
      <strong>5. Uses of Lilies:</strong><br>

        </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pests:</strong> Lilies are prone to pests like aphids, lily beetles, slugs, and snails, which can damage leaves, stems, and flowers.</li>
        <li><strong>Diseases:</strong> Fungal diseases such as botrytis (gray mold) and root rot can affect lilies. Ensuring good air circulation and proper watering can help prevent these issues.</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>9. Interesting Facts:</strong><br>
